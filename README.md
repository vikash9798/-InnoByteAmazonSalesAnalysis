# Customer and Sales Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project involves analyzing customer and sales data to gain valuable insights into various business operations, including sales performance, customer satisfaction, inventory management, and more. The analysis was conducted using **Python** in **Jupyter Notebook** with the help of several powerful libraries.

## Objectives
- Identify top-performing and underperforming products.
- Analyze fulfillment efficiency and delivery performance.
- Understand customer behavior through segmentation and satisfaction analysis.
- Detect seasonal trends and optimize inventory management.
- Evaluate promotional effectiveness and their impact on sales.

## Libraries Used
The following Python libraries were utilized in this project:
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and statistical analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: For advanced and interactive data visualizations.
- **GeoPandas**: For geographical data analysis and mapping.
- **Scipy**: For advanced statistical computations.

## Key Features and Visualizations
